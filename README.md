Each grid of 16 hanzi is built from 8 random seed words. Tap 2 hanzi and, if they turn green, you've found one - find them all to get a new grid. When you guess a pair, it'll be added to your list, and they'll be converted to their traditional form. 
These 16 hanzi might contain more than just those 8 combinations... when you find such a word, the tiles will briefly turn gold, and the word added to your list.
