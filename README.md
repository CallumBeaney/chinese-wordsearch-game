每个网格包含从八词汇源自十六个的汉字。点击两个汉字按钮，如果成为绿色的话，你发现一个！一旦你全部找到，就会生成一个新的网格。但是，那十六个汉子可能包含那八个词以外的汉字组合。当你找到这样的词时，瓷砖会短暂地变成金色。  
  
Each grid of 16 hanzi is built from 8 random seed words. Tap 2 hanzi and, if they turn green, you've found one - find them all to get a new grid. When you guess a pair, it'll be added to your list, and they'll be converted to their traditional form. 
These 16 hanzi might contain more than just those 8 combinations... when you find such a word, the tiles will briefly turn gold, and the word added to your list.
